information on IaaS
what is Iaas?
imagine you and your team are devoping a new applicatioin that needs to run somewhere 
you company can get servers to run the application but also it will need a dedicated team who will be incharge of running and maintaining the servers which can be a difficult task
instead of doing so, the company can delegate infrastructure management to someone or another organisation to mananger the infrascture and just rent the servers as per when
you need it.

Companies such as AWS cloud, Digital Ocean, Azure, GCP all provide this service (IaaS) because they manage the infrastructure for you and you just rent them 
AWS is the most used of all.
